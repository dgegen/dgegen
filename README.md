### Hi there, I'm David

I'm a PhD student in the [Queloz Group at ETH Zurich](https://queloz-group.ethz.ch/), specialising in the analysis of duotransits, with a general passion for formally reducing interesting physical questions to computationally tractable models.
Moreover, I have a keen interest in scientific software development and am an advocate for fostering a scientific culture centered on self-consistent, open-source, reusable, reproducible and testable practices.
